# Git Definitions
## A guide for beginners

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to view the history of revisions made to files in a repository and merge the changes together. It is useful in making sure that you are working with the most up-to-date version of a project, as well as giving you the option of rolling back to a previous version of the project if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in Git is the best way to work on different features of a project in a repository. This keeps your master branch clean and functioning as your try out different features and edits in other branches. When a branch is reviewed and error-free, you can merge it into the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit creates a "save point" for the files and folders in the project you're working on. A commit has a unique ID, a message describing the commit, the name of the author who created the commit, and a time stamp.
A good commit message is descriptive enough to give other team members or managers a good idea of exactly what you have built or changed. A good commit message is written in the present tense.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict can occur when merging changes in Git. If two people edited the same line of code in the same file, or if one person deleted a line that someone else has edited, Git cannot determine which line is correct. Git will mark the file as having a conflict that will have to be manually resolved.
