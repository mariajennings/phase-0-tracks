REFLECTION:
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags explain how specifically the brower shoould display the HTML elements. I think forms are very helpeful, as they enable us to interact with webpages and collect/submit data.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
HTML loads elements from start to finish/top to bottom.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets are amazing! I learned that Sublime allows you to create snippets/shortcuts you can use while coding. I made one for unorderd lists. I think I will also create one for tables soon.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I am still working to wrap my head around what all the HTML elements do and how to best use them. The HTML documentation has been very helpful, and I need to keep reading it!
